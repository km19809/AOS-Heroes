Thank you for getting our Hand Painted Modular Icon Package!

There are dozens of built-in icons, ready to drag and drop into your game.  These are great for GUI icons, Button icons & more.

The included .PSD files will allow you to create new, unique and custom icons, as well as modify the included ones.  Each file contains layers for all of the included icons, so you can easily change the colors or add/remove/modify the elements.

Create a new layer group (or simply copy and rename a current group) and copy/paste elements from various icons to create your own unique icons.

You have full rights to use these in any commercial game, however you do not have the right to re-sell the icons, including icons you make using various elements.
